# Still To Do:
# 1) All the utilities could be put in a separate utils or initialization file.
# 2) logging with default level ERROR could be added to debug the code
# 3) naked_twins can be split up in two methods find_twins, eliminate twins to enhance readability.
# 4) reduce_puzzle needs a description 
# 5) naked_tuples and another related concept hidden twins could be implemented
